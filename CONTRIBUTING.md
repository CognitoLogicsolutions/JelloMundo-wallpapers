1. Fork the repo and create your branch (`feat/new-portal`).
2. Add high-res wallpapers (4K preferred) to `wallpapers/raw-ai/` or `human-remix/`.
3. Ensure file names are descriptive (e.g., `neon-handshake-v1.png`).
4. Update the Gallery table in `README.md` if you want a featured spot.
5. Open a Pull Request and tell us: "What's your twist?" 🍮
