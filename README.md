## The Show: Character Personas 👤
JELLO MUNDO is powered by the **Cognito Logic Triarch**, a system of three sovereign personas:

*   **Boy 1: The Ghost (Sense/Intake)** - The Data Sentinel. Purges legacy noise and ensures 2026 API compliance. 
    *   *Motto:* "If it doesn't belong in 2026, it doesn't exist."
*   **Boy 2: The Architect (Decide/Execute)** - The System Orchestrator. Designs directory structures and executes vault injections.
*   **Boy 3: The Sovereign (Future/Commercial)** - The Commercial Manager. Protects the "Living Man" standing and manages global storefronts.
